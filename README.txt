Two player Tic Tac Toe Java Swing GUI Project. I made this before learning any front end web development.
This project simulates two players playing tic tac toe on two different devices by having two boards displayed.
They communicate with each other so that when one player makes a move on their board, it shows up on the other.

Classes:
-MyFrame.java: Custom JFrame class that sets the dimensions
-TicTacToePlayerPanel.java: Custom JPanel for a player
-TicTacToeGame.java: Game logic with main method

Run TicTacToeGame.java to play
